= ADR 0007 - Version Number

*Status:* accepted

*Date:* 2018-12-01

== Context and Problem Statement

The software needs an unique version number for each release.
There are different common practices available.

== Considered Options

* MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g 0.8.5)
* YEAR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g 2018.1.3)

== Decision Outcome

*Chosen option:* YEAR.MINOR.PATCH

* It is confusing, when MAJOR should change.
* YEAR gives extra information about the release date.
