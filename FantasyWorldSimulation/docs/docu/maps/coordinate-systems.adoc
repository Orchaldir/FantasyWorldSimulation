=== Map Coordinate Systems

Each map has its own *Map Coordinate System* based on its regular grid of cells.

=== World Coordinate System

The *World Coordinate System* is the coordinate system in which all features are defined.
It does not matter to which map a feature belongs.

This has multiple advantages:

* No coordinate conversion between maps.
* Easier to understand by the user.
* Changing the resolution of a map does not change the coordinates of its features.

=== Screen Coordinate System

The final result of the map editor is a highly detailed image displayed in the gui or saved to a file.
