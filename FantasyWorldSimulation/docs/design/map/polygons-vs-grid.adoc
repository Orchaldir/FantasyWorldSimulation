[%header,cols="1a,1a"]
|===
| Polygon Map
| Grid

|
* Better looking
* Fewer cells
** Faster algorithms (e.g A*)
* Border for rivers, coastlines, cliffs, ...

|
* Smaller Cells
** Realms can slowly grow
** Changes to smaller areas can be tracked
** Changes to sea level affect smaller areas
* Faster map generation
* Fixed layout
** Fixed Number of neighbors
** Fast look up of cell at a position
